With the advent of large scale synthetic power systems, this research looks to understand and optimize new modal analysis techniques that were specifically designed to be able to handle large scale power systems. The primary method I am looking at is the Iterative Matrix Pencil method, which has undergone testing against other existing techniques, like Dynamic Mode Decomposition. I am primarily interested in using the Iterative Matrix Pencil method to analyze and understand the nature of system modes, and potentially use this knowledge to develop appropriate techniques to damp out oscillations that occur in the grid.
